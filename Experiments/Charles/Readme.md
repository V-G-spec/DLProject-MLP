## To do: add the weights to the google drive link
You can load the weights for the VGG-13bn model from this [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aIWc87WfqGGtjGPHJe62tXzO6e5VoWcy?usp=sharing) and save it at `state_dicts/`

THese weights and the code for the model were obtained from this [Github repository](https://github.com/huyvnphan/PyTorch_CIFAR10)
